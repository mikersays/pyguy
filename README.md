Python3 Environment Setup Script
This script automates the process of setting up a Python3 environment and installing a list of popular Python3 packages. It is intended to save you time and ensure consistency across different systems.

Prerequisites
This script requires both Python3 and pip3 installed on your system. The script will check for these before proceeding.

Python3: If Python3 is not installed, you will need to install it first. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

pip3: This is a Python package installer. It usually comes with the Python installation. If pip3 is not installed, follow the instructions on this page: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Virtual Environment (optional)
The script has the option to create a Python virtual environment. This is not required, but it is recommended for isolating your Python environment and avoiding conflicts with other packages or Python versions installed on your system.

If you do not wish to use a virtual environment, you may comment out or delete the lines regarding virtual environment setup (creating and activating the venv).

Packages Installed
The script installs the following popular Python3 packages:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
scipy
requests
beautifulsoup4
Flask
Django
sqlalchemy
pytest
jupyter
pylint
tensorflow
keras
torch
Running the Script
Download the script to a local directory.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.
Run the script using the following command:
`./script-name.sh`
Replace script-name.sh with the actual name of the script file.
After running the script, all the listed packages will be installed, and you can start using them for your Python projects. Enjoy coding!
